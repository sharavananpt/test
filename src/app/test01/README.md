Test #1:

1. Create the responsive web layout seen in the **specs** folder: **mock-mobile.png**; **mock-one-button.png**; **mock-desktop.png**; and **mock-tablet.png**. Use bootstrap 3 grid and any css styles using sass or less.
2. Create a service that loads data in **assets/data.json** using RxJS or Promise and populates the button list of your **Test01Component**.
3. Create the buttons using **ngFor** and load the text copy from the model.
4. Change the buttons text copy to another language (can be lorem ipsum) using Angular localization or any localization library when changing the locale key, example 'en' or 'fr'
5. Create an Angular component or directive that will create equal heights for all buttons if the text is too long and wraps inside one of the buttons. See the mobile vs tablet image.
6. If there is only one button then center the button as seen in **mock-one-button.png**.
